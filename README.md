What was working and looking nice:
* The html file is easy to read and orgonized
* colors on the page
* fonts are readable
* The buttons that change the images on the page: Nude, Pinup , Fetish

What was working less good:
* The css file is a bit messy
* The text box is not working perfect, is not fully responsive (do not use slider for text, hard to make resposnive)
* used pixeles and not %
